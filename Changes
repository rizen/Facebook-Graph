1.0000 2010-12-09
 - Updated recipe2 example to use more modern Dancer features.
 - Merged POD patch from fayland.
 - Can now post posts and events directly to other pages you control without
  switching access tokens.
 - Added set_source(), set_privacy(), set_actions(), add_actions(),
  set_target_countries(), set_target_cities(), set_target_regions(), and
  set_target_locales to Facebook::Graph::Publish::Post.
 - Changed get_post_params() in Facebook::Graph::Publish to return an array ref
  instead of a hash ref.
 - Now requires Exception::Class.

 NOTE: This version is not backward compatible with previous versions because
 the get_post_params() method in Facebook::Graph::Publish now returns an array
 ref rather than a hash ref. However, if you didn't extend this module, then you
 likely aren't calling this method anywhere, so for you the module will remain
 backward compatible. This is the reason for the major version number increase.

 NOTE2: This version is not backward compatible with previous versions because
 we are no longer throwing array based exceptions. Instead the exceptions are
 Exception::Class based. If you don't care about exception formatting then this
 module will still be backward compatible for you.
