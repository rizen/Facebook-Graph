=head1 NAME

Facebook::Graph::Query - Simple and fast searching and fetching of Facebook data.

=head1 SYNOPSIS

 my $fb = Facebook::Graph->new;
 
 my $perl_page = $fb->find('16665510298')
    ->include_metadata
    ->request
    ->as_hashref;
 
 my $sarah_bownds = $fb->find('sarahbownds')
    ->select_fields(qw(id name))
    ->request
    ->as_hashref;

 # this one would require an access token
 my $new_years_posts = $fb->query
    ->from('posts')
    ->where_since('1 January 2011')
    ->where_until('2 January 2011')
    ->limit(25)
    ->request
    ->as_hashref;

 # this one would require an access token
 my $new_car_posts = $fb->query
    ->search('car', 'my_news')
    ->where_since('yesterday')
    ->request
    ->as_hashref;


=head1 DESCRIPTION

This module presents a programatic approach to building the queries necessary to search and retrieve Facebook data. It provides an almost SQL like way of writing queries using code. For example:

 my $results = $fb
    ->select_fields(qw(id name))
    ->search('Dave','user')
    ->where_since('yesterday')
    ->limit_results(25)
    ->request
    ->as_hashref;
    
The above query, if you were read it like text, says: "Give me the user ids and full names of all users named Dave that have been created since yesterday, and limit the result set to the first 25."


=head1 METHODS

=head2 find ( id )

Fetch a single item.

=head3 id

The unique id or object name of an object.

B<Example:> For user "Sarah Bownds" you could use either her profile id C<sarahbownds> or her object id C<767598108>.




=head2 from ( context )



If you prefer to search by keyword see the C<search> method.

=head3 context

One of the following contexts:

=over

=item my_news

The current user's news feed (home page). Requires that you have an access_token so you know who the current user is.

=item post

All public posts.

=item user

All people.

=item page

All pages.

=item event

All events.

=item group

All groups.




=head2 search ( query, context )

Perform a keyword search on a group of items. 

If you prefer not to search by keyword see the C<from> method.

=head3 query

They keywords to search by.

=head3 context

See the C<context> param in the C<from> method.

=back



=head2 limit_results ( amount )

The result set will only return a certain number of records when this is set. Useful for paging result sets. Returns C<$self> for method chaining.

=head3 amount

An integer representing the number of records to be returned.



=head2 offset_results ( amount )

Skips ahead the result set by the amount. Useful for paging result sets. Is only applied when used in combination with C<limit_results>. Returns C<$self> for method chaining.

=head3 amount

An integer representing the amount to offset the results by.



=head2 include_metadata ( [ include ] )

Adds metadata to the result set including things like connections to other objects and the object type being returned. Returns C<$self> for method chaining.

=head3 include

Defaults to 1 when the method is called, but defaults to 0 if the method is never called. You may set it specifically by passing in a 1 or 0.


=head2 select_fields ( fields )

Limit the result set to only include the specific fields if they exist in the objects in the result set. Returns C<$self> for method chaining. May be called multiple times to add more fields.

=head3 fields

An array of fields you want in the result set.

B<Example:> 'id', 'name', 'picture'


=head2 where_ids ( ids )

Limit the result set to these specifically identified objects. Returns C<$self> for method chaining. May be called multiple times to add more ids.

=head3 ids

An array of object ids, object names, or URIs.

B<Example:> 'http://www.thegamecrafter.com/', 'sarahbownds', '16665510298'


=head2 where_until ( date )

Include only records that were created before C<date>. Returns C<$self> for method chaining.

=head3 date

Anything accepted by PHP's strtotime function L<http://php.net/manual/en/function.strtotime.php>.


=head2 where_since ( date )

Include only records that have been created since C<date>. Returns C<$self> for method chaining.

=head3 date

Anything accepted by PHP's strtotime function L<http://php.net/manual/en/function.strtotime.php>.


=head2 uri_as_string ()

Returns a URI string based upon all the methods you've called so far on the query. Mainly useful for debugging. Usually you want to call C<request> and have it fetch the data for you.



=head2 request ( [ uri ] )

Forms a URI string based on every method you've called so far, and fetches the data. Returns a L<Facebook::Graph::Response> object.

=head3 uri

Optionally pass in your own URI string and all the other options will be ignored. This is mainly useful with metadata connections. See C<include_metadata> for details.
